1,1,"(Man)"," 'Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world,    I think about the arrival's gate at Heathrow airport.    General opinion started to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed,    but I don't see that. Seems to me that love is everywhere.    Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it's always there.    Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends.    When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know,    none of the phone calls from people on board were messages of hate or revenge,    they were all messages of love.    If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling, you'll find that love actually is all around.' "

24,276,"Daniel","  Er... No, you're right. Total agony.(고통)  "
25,277,"Karl","  Night, Sarah."
25,278,"Sarah","  Night, Karl. Yeah, absolutely. Free as a bird. Fire away.  "
26,279,"Jamie","  Alone again. Naturally.  "
27,280,"man","  I'll deal with it."
27,281,"PM","   Mm. "
27,282,"PM","   Ah. Natalie."
27,283,"Natalie"," Sir."
27,284,"PM","   Thanks. Natalie. Erm, I'm starting to feel... uncomfortable about us     working in such close proximity every day and me knowing so little about you,     it seems elitist and wrong. "
27,285,"Natalie"," Well, there's not much to know."
27,286,"PM","   Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?"
27,287,"Natalie"," Wandsworth. The dodgy end."
27,288,"PM","   Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth."
27,289,"Natalie"," Oh."
27,290,"PM","   So which exactly is the dodgy end?"
27,291,"Natalie"," Right at the end of the high street, Harris Street, near the Queen's Head."
27,292,"PM","   Right, yes, that is dodgy."
27,293,"Natalie"," Hm."
27,294,"PM","   Erm, and you live with your husband? Boyfriend? - Three illegitimate(사생아의) but charming children?"
27,295,"Natalie"," No. I've just split up with my boyfriend actually, so I'm back with my mum and dad for a while."
27,296,"PM","   Ah. Sorry."
27,297,"Natalie"," No, it's fine. I'm well shot of him. - He said I was getting fat."
27,298,"PM","   I beg your pardon?"
27,299,"Natalie"," He said no one'd fancy a girl with thighs the size of tree trunks.     Not a nice guy, actually, in the end."
27,300,"PM","   Right... You know, erm... being Prime Minister, I could just have him murdered."
27,301,"Natalie"," Thank you, sir. I'll think about it."
27,302,"PM","   Do. The SAS are absolutely charming. Ruthless,(무자비한)     trained killers are just a phone call away. Oh, God. Did you have this kind of problem?     Yeah, course you did, you saucy(뻔뻔스런)  minx. (왈가닥, 말괄량이)  "
28,303,"Daniel","  So, let's go. We can definitely crack this. Remember, I was a kid once, too.     So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?"
28,304,"Sam","  Yeah."
28,305,"Daniel","  Uh-huh. Good, good. And what does she, he, feel about you? "
28,306,"Sam","  SHE doesn't even know my name. And even if she did, she'd despise(멸시하다) me.     She's the coolest girl in school. And everyone worships her because she's heaven."
28,307,"Daniel","  Good. Good. Well, basically you're fucked, aren't you?  "
29,308,"Ant"," Hi there and welcome back. So, three weeks till Christmas,    looks like the real competition is gonna be Blue."
29,309,"Billy"," I saw them on the show last week. They weren't very nice about my record."
29,310,"Dec"," No. Little scamps. (약간은 망나니들 같다.)"
29,311,"Billy"," But very, very talented musicians."
29,312,"Ant"," Yeah. Billy, I understand you've got a prize for our competition winners."
29,313,"Billy"," Yes, I have, Ant or Dec. It's a personalised felt-tip pen."
29,314,"Dec"," Oh, great."
29,315,"Billy"," It's brilliant. It even writes on glass, so if you've got a framed picture,    like, for instance, this one of Blue, you can just write on it."
29,316,"Dec"," Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy."
29,317,"Billy"," Oh, yes."
29,318,"Billy"," Hiya, kids. Here's an important message from your Uncle Bill - don't buy drugs.     Become a pop star and they give you them for free."
29,319,"Dec"," And I do believe it's a commercial break. Thanks goodness. We'll see you soon. Bye!  "
30,320,"girls"," Look at him! Eurh!"
30,321,"Mark"," Just a minute. Actually, they're not funny. They're art."
30,322,"Mark"," OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place."
30,323,"Peter"," Great. …but for now, I've got Juliet on the other line.    Can I patch you through? she wants to ask you a favour."
30,324,"Mark"," OK, fine."
30,325,"Peter"," Thanks and, er, be nice."
30,326,"Mark"," I'm always nice."
30,327,"Peter"," 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.'"
30,328,"Mark"," I'm always..."
30,329,"Juliet"," 'Mark?'"
30,330,"Mark"," Hi. How was the honeymoon?"
30,331,"Juliet"," oh It was great. Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff."
30,332,"Mark"," So, what can I do for you?"
30,333,"Juliet"," It's only a tiny favour. I've just tried the wedding video and it's a complete disaster.    It's come out all blue and wibbly.'"
30,334,"Mark"," I'm sorry."
30,335,"Juliet"," And I remember you filming a lot on the day - and I just wondered if I could look at your stuff."
30,336,"Mark"," Oh no - look - To be honest, I didn't really..."
30,337,"Juliet"," Please. All I want is just one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn't bright turquoise."
30,338,"Mark"," Okay , - I'll have a look -  but to be honest I'm pretty sure I wiped it, so don't get any hopes up.    'Must go.'  "
31,339,"Harry"," Any progress with our matchmaking plans? "
31,340,"Sarah"," No. I've done fuck-all and never will because he's too good for me."
31,341,"Harry"," How true."
31,342,"Sarah"," Stop. "
31,343,"Harry"," And of course, your mobile goes."
31,344,"Sarah"," Hello. Hi. How you doing?"
31,345,"Harry"," So, how's the Christmas party going?"
31,346,"Mia"," Good. Think I've found a venue. Friend of mine works there."
31,347,"Harry"," What's it like?"
31,348,"Mia"," Good. Good. It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners for doing dark deeds."
31,349,"Harry"," Oh. Right. Good. Well, I suppose I should take a look at it or something."
31,350,"Mia"," You should.  "
32,351,"Jamie"," Ah, bonjour, Eleonore."
32,352,"woman"," Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back. And this year you bring a lady guest?   "
32,353,"Jamie"," No. There's a change of situation. Just me."
32,354,"woman"," Oh. Am I sad or not sad?"
32,355,"Jamie"," I think you're not surprised."
32,356,"woman"," And you stay here till Christmas?"
32,357,"Jamie"," Yeah, yeah."
32,358,"woman","  Good. Well, I find you a perfect lady to clean the house. This is Aurelia."
32,359,"Jamie"," Ah. Er, bonjour, Aurelia."
32,360,"Aurelia"," Bonjour."
32,361,"Jamie"," (French) Er, je suis, er, tres heureux de vous avoir ici."
32,362,"woman"," Unfortunately, she cannot speak French, just like you. She's Portuguese."
32,363,"Jamie"," (ltalian) Ah, ah, buongiorno. Eusebio, er, er... (Pidgin Spanish) Er, molto bueno..."
32,364,"woman"," I think she's ten years too young to remember a footballer called Eusebio.    And ""molto bueno"" is Spanish."
32,365,"Jamie"," Right. Anyway, it's nice to meet you and..."
32,366,"woman"," And perhaps you can drive her home after her work?"
32,367,"Jamie"," Oh, absolutely, yes.  Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura."

34,377,"US Pr","  Really? I've never found that."
34,378,"PM","  Yes, well, the difference is that you're sickeningly handsome,    whereas I look increasingly like my Aunt Mildred. I'm very jealous of your plane, by the way."
34,379,"US Pr"," Thank you. We love that thing. I'll tell you."
34,380,"PM","  Ah, Natalie. Hi."
34,381,"US Pr"," Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?"
34,382,"US Pr"," Excellent. My goodness, that's a pretty little son of a bitch. Did you see those pipes?"
34,383,"PM","  Yes, she's terrific… at her job."
34,384,"minister1"," No, absolutely not. We cannot and will not consult on that either."
34,385,"Alex"," That is unexpected."
34,386,"US Pr"," Well, it shouldn't be. The last administration made it perfectly clear.    We are just being consistent with their policies."
34,387,"Alex"," But, with all respect, they were bad policies."
34,388,"PM","  Right, Thanks, Alex. I don't think we're making progress here. Let's, erm... move on, shall we?"
34,389,"PM","  Well, now, that was an interesting day."
34,390,"US Pr"," I'm sorry if our line was firm - there's no point  tiptoeing around today,    and then just disappointing you for four years.  I have plans and I plan to see them through."
34,391,"PM","  Absolutely. There is one final thing I think we should look at - very close to my heart.    If you could just give me a second."
34,392,"US Pr"," I'll give you anything you ask for. As long as it's not something I don't wanna give."
34,393,"PM","  Hi."
34,394,"US Pr"," It's great Scotch."
34,395,"Natalie"," I'll, erm... I'll be going, then."
34,396,"US Pr","  Er, Natalie, I hope to see much more of you as our countries work toward a better future."
34,397,"Natalie"," Thank you, sir. "
35,398,"PM","  Er, yes, Peter."
35,399,"Peter(press)","  Mr President, has it been a good visit?"
35,400,"US Pr","  Very satisfactory indeed.     We got what we came for and our special relationship is still very special."
35,401,"press2","  Prime Minister?"
35,402,"PM","  I love that word ""relationship"". Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?    I fear that this has become a bad relationship. A relationship based on the President    taking what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to, erm... Britain.    We may be a small country but we're a great one, too. The country of Shakespeare, Churchill,    the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left foot,    come to that. And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend.    And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward,    I will be prepared to be much stronger. And the President should be prepared for that."
35,403,"Press"," Mr. President! "
36,404,"woman"," It's your sister on line four."
36,405,"PM","  All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy and important, how can I help you?"
36,406,"Karen"," Have you gone completely insane?"
36,407,"PM","  You can't  be sensible all the time."
36,408,"Karen"," You can. if you're Prime Minister."
36,409,"PM","  It's the Chancellor on the other line."
36,410,"Karan"," It isn't!"
36,411,"PM","  I'll call you back."
36,412,"Karen","  No, you won't!    The trouble with being the Prime Minister's sister is it puts your life into rather harsh perspective.    What did my brother do today? He stood up and fought for his country.    And what did I do? I made a papier - mache lobster head."
36,413,"Harry"," What is this we're listening to?"
36,414,"Karen"," Joni Mitchell."
